Hi Ilana,

We’d like you to complete this assignment as part of our hiring process. It’s meant to assess your skills in Python and give us an idea of how you approach it.

Please complete it no later than a week.

I’ll be glad to answer any questions, so feel free to contact us anytime (Amit is CC'd).

 

 

The task:

 

Implement a pattern Python3 script that searches for a pattern using a regular expression in lines of text, and prints the lines which contain matching text.

The script's output format should be: "file_name line_number line".

 

Guidelines:

Assume the input is in ASCII, there’s no need to deal with different encodings.
Multiple matches on a single line are allowed without overlapping.
The script should be usable out of the box on a Linux machine.
Please add proper documentation and error handling.
The script should adhere to PEP8 coding guidelines.
Please provide a list of any external libraries used.
 

Implementation is up for you to decide and using OOP is preferred. When using OOP, please describe the design pattern that was used.

 

The script accepts the following parameters:

-r, --regex       mandatory - the regular expression to search for regular.

-f, --files       optional - a list of files to search in. If this parameter is omitted, the script expects text input from STDIN.

 

These extra parameters are mutually exclusive:

-u, --underline   optional - "^" is printed underneath the matched text.

-c, --color       optional - the matched text is highlighted in color [1].

-m, --machine     optional - print the output in the format: "file_name:line_number:start_position:matched_text".

 

Hint: It is recommended to use a module for parsing the command line arguments and the "re" module for matching the pattern.
